<h2>And the play continues</h2>
<h6 class="name">DROMIO OF EPHESUS</h6>
<p class= "speech DROMIOOFEPHESUS">O,--sixpence, that I had o' Wednesday last
To pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper?
The saddler had it, sir; I kept it not.</p>

<h6 class="name">ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE</h6>
<p class= "speech ANTIPHOLUSOFSYRACUSE">I am not in a sportive humour now:
Tell me, and dally not, where is the money?
We being strangers here, how darest thou trust
So great a charge from thine own custody?</p>

<h6 class="name">DROMIO OF EPHESUS</h6>
<p class= "speech DROMIOOFEPHESUS">I pray you, air, as you sit at dinner:
I from my mistress come to you in post;
If I return, I shall be post indeed,
For she will score your fault upon my pate.
Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock,
And strike you home without a messenger.</p>
