        <h3>The Comedy of Errors</h3>

        Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse, DROMIO of Syracuse, and First Merchant
<h6 class="name">First Merchant</h6>
<p class= "speech FirstMerchant">Therefore give out you are of Epidamnum,
Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate.
This very day a Syracusian merchant
Is apprehended for arrival here;
And not being able to buy out his life
According to the statute of the town,
Dies ere the weary sun set in the west.
There is your money that I had to keep.</p>

<h6  class="name">ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE</h6>
<p class= "speech ANTIPHOLUSOFSYRACUSE">Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host,
And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.
Within this hour it will be dinner-time:
Till that, I'll view the manners of the town,
Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,
And then return and sleep within mine inn,
For with long travel I am stiff and weary.
Get thee away.</p>

<h6 class="name">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</h6>
<p class= "speech DROMIOOFSYRACUSE">Many a man would take you at your word,
And go indeed, having so good a mean.</p>
<p class="stage-diredction">Exit</p>

<h6 class="name">ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE</h6>
<p class= "speech ANTIPHOLUSOFSYRACUSE">A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,
When I am dull with care and melancholy,
Lightens my humour with his merry jests.
What, will you walk with me about the town,
And then go to my inn and dine with me?</p>

<h6 class="name">First Merchant</h6>
<p class= "speech FirstMerchant">I am invited, sir, to certain merchants,
Of whom I hope to make much benefit;
I crave your pardon. Soon at five o'clock,
Please you, I'll meet with you upon the mart
And afterward consort you till bed-time:
My present business calls me from you now.</p>

<h6 class="name">ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE</h6>
<p class= "speech ANTIPHOLUSOFSYRACUSE">Farewell till then: I will go lose myself
And wander up and down to view the city.</p>

<h6 class="name">First Merchant</h6>
<p class= "speech first merchant">Sir, I commend you to your own content.</p>
<p class="stage-diredction">Exit</p>

<h6 class="name">ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE</h6>
<p class= "speech ANTIPHOLUSOFSYRACUSE">He that commends me to mine own content
Commends me to the thing I cannot get.
I to the world am like a drop of water
That in the ocean seeks another drop,
Who, falling there to find his fellow forth,
Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself:
So I, to find a mother and a brother,
In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.</p>
<P class="stage-diredction">Enter DROMIO of Ephesus</P>
<p class= "speech ANTIPHOLUSOFSYRACUSE">Here comes the almanac of my true date.</p>
<p class= "speech ANTIPHOLUSOFSYRACUSE">What now? how chance thou art return'd so soon?</p>

<h6 class="name">DROMIO OF EPHESUS</h6>
<p class= "speech DROMIOOFSYRACUSE">Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:
The capon burns, the pig falls from the spit,
The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell;
My mistress made it one upon my cheek:
She is so hot because the meat is cold;
The meat is cold because you come not home;
You come not home because you have no stomach;
You have no stomach having broke your fast;
But we that know what 'tis to fast and pray
Are penitent for your default to-day.</p>

<h6 class="name">ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE</h6>
<p class= "speech ANTIPHOLUSOFSYRACUSE">Stop in your wind, sir: tell me this, I pray:
Where have you left the money that I gave you?</p>
